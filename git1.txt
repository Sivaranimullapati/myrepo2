Git : Git is a version control system that tracks the changes to files. Here's how it works:
 1. Repository : A Git repository stores the complete history of changes.
2. Commits: Changes are saved in snapshots called commits.
3.Branches: Branches allow you to diverge from the main line of development and work on different features independently.
4.merge : git merge command allows us take the independent lines of development created by git branch and merge them into a single branch.

Git commands :

1. git init : Initializes a new Git repository.
2. git clone <repository-url> : Copies a repository from a server to our computer.
3.git status : Shows the status of changes in your working directory.
4. git add : it adds the changes whatever we made.
5. git commit :This will opens a text editor to write the commit message.
6.git log : displays the commit history.
7.git branch <branch-name> : Creates a new branch.
8. git merge <branch-name> : it merges branch into the main branch.
9. git push : It transfers commits from local main branch to the main branch in the remote repository.
10. git pull : it is used to fetch the changes from remote repository to our local repository.
